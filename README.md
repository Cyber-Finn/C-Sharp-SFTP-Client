# C-Sharp SFTP Client
A very basic C# client that lets you connect to an SFTP server to download or upload files.

I will be updating this eventually to make the front-end look more modern and take input params, instead of having the info changed in the code.
<br>
This solution currently only serves as a code-sample of how to connect to an SFTP site, using the front-end as-is is not recommended.

Actual functionality code can be found in the "Form1.cs" file
